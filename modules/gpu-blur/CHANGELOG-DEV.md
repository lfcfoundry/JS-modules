# gpu-blur developer changelog

What changed in each version, newest first, for developers, in three depths: Quick (what changed and whether old code breaks), Details (API, numbers with the browser named, how to upgrade) and Deep (design reasons, tests, what was tried). Users read CHANGELOG.md. The API number goes up only when someone using an older copy could be affected.

### Quick
New: GpuBlur, a picture blur that uses WebGL 2 where the device is fast at it, then WebAssembly, then plain JavaScript. All three give the same picture, and big jobs run in short slices.
