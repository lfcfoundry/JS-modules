# netflow-circular developer changelog

## 1.0.0 · API 1 · 2026-11-01
- **Quick:** split from Netflow Map src/charts.js (main 35db3f4, build 2026.11.01.1003) by view type, on the owner's ask.
- **Details:** netflow-hierarchy keeps the tree, values, nested layouts and the drawing frame; scene(L, o, NS, ext) takes an extension that draws its own view types. netflow-circular holds chord, bundles, bsplineToBezier and the ribbon drawing and draws inside that frame. Characters above U+007F written as escapes. Layout, SVG, names and the note line identical to the app copy on 756 layouts and pictures (7 views, 9 map sizes up to 3,000 items, 6 option sets, 2 themes); the app's 925 checks pass on the two together.
